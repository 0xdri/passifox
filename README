PassIFox extension for Firefox

Implements a transparent replacement for the built-in Firefox password storage

This extension is for use with https://github.com/pfn/keepasshttp

Prereqs:
    1) KeePass
       http://keepass.info/
    2) KeePassHttp
       https://github.com/pfn/keepasshttp/raw/master/KeePassHttp.plgx

Install:
    1) Copy KeePassHttp.plgx to C:\Path\To\KeePass.exe\Dir

Configuration:
    There is no explicit configuration necessary. KeePassFox and KeePassHttp
    will communicate with each other on http://localhost:19455/

    When a login form is discovered for the first time, KeePassFox will
    initialize itself and request an "Association" with KeePass (KeePassHttp).
    Alternatively, for forms that do not fill automatically, a context menu
    item on text and password fields allow manually filling in a login.

    Once that is completed, Firefox can freely retrieve passwords from
    KeePass. KeePass must be running and unlocked in order for passwords
    to be available.

    Entries in KeePass can be stored as http://host.name/ or just host.name
    without any extra fluff. KeePassHttp will do the work to figure out what
    you want. There are some permissions things where KeePassHttp will
    notify you when passwords are requested and the hostnames do not exactly
    match. When those prompts occur, you can accept, deny and remember your
    choice.
